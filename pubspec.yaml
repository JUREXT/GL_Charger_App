  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/full_battery_charge.jpg
    - assets/images/charging_station.png
    - assets/images/logo_25_size.png
    - assets/images/logo_50_size.png
    - assets/images/logo_100_size.png
    - assets/images/ic_user.png
    - assets/images/ic_clear_24px.png
    - assets/images/ic_done_24px.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: SF
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/SF-UI-Text-Regular.ttf
    - family: Inter
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Black.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-ExtraBold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-ExtraLight.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Light.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Medium.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-SemiBold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Thin.ttf
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
